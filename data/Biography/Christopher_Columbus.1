Christopher Columbus was a trader and explorer. He was born in Genoa, Italy by a wool weaver in 1451 and died May 20, 1506 in Valladolid. While he did not actually discover the Americas, he discovered the Bahamas, however close to the Americas. He was once called the first European to find out because people already lived at the Americas, though it is known now that the Vikings did this earlier.
Columbus sailed the Atlantic Ocean because he was hoping to find a shorter, safer way to China and India. He wanted to bring back spices and gold for the King and Queen of Spain: Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon. He knew that the world was round but he did not know how large it was. He had heard that Marco Polo had found a sea to the east of China and he believed that it must be the same as sea to the west of Europe. He did not really know about the Pacific Ocean and The Americas, and that the Atlantic Ocean did not go all the way to China.
When he found some islands at the end of his voyage, he thought he had reached the East Indies when in fact he had landed on an island in the Bahamas. That is why he named the people living there "Indians". In all, he made four voyages to America. Colombia is also named after him.
There is disagreement on where Columbus came from. Numerous people think that he was born in Genoa. Experts have studied clues to Columbus' birthplace, but no final answer has been found.
He was arrested in Santo Domingo August 23, 1500. Sent to Spain in chains in October 1500. Released December 12, 1500 and summoned to court. His passions were exploring and navigating. He piloted five voyages to the Bahamas believing he had reached the Indies. he found America
