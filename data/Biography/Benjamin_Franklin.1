Benjamin Franklin (January 17, 1706 - April 17, 1790) was one of the "Founding Fathers" of the United States, and one of the country's earliest politicians. He had a very important part in shaping the American Revolution, even though he was never elected to any official position. As a leader of the Enlightenment, he influenced European scientists. He even was the first thing many Europeans associated with America at the time. His success with the French military was an important factor in America's win over Great Britain.
Most people see Franklin as one of history's greatest inventors. Some of his greatest creations include the lightning rod, bifocals (a type of eyeglasses), the idea of unity in the Thirteen Colonies, and the idea of America itself.
The city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (where he lived) marked his three hundredth birthday in 2006.
Franklin is frequently seen on the United States' hundred-dollar bill as a mark of brilliance and a tribute to its past.
