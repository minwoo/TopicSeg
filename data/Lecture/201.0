Hey, the back of the line is over there. 
I was here. 
I just stepped out of line for a minute to get some cash. 
Yeah, right. 
I don't remember you being in line ahead of me . 
Come on. 
Let's do this. 
We'll flip for it. 
If it's heads , I win and I get to get back into line. 
If it's tails , you win and I'll go to the back of the line. 
All right. 
I'll take those odds . 
You're on. 
Here goes¡¦ 
Oh, it's heads! 
I win. 
I guess it's your lucky day. 
I guess so. 
How about going double or nothing ? 
What are the stakes ? 
If it's tails and you win, I go to the back of the line and I have to buy you a drink when we get inside. 
If it's heads and I win, I get back in line in front of you and you buy me a drink. 
So, no matter what happens I have to have a drink with you? 
That's the idea. 
What do you say? 
Okay, you talked me into it. 
Let's see if your luck will hold up . 
I've got a good feeling it will.
