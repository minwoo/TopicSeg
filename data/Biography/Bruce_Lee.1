He died while filming a movie called, 'Game of Death', during the height of his popularity (almost 20 years later his son, Brandon Lee would die while filming a movie, too). Lee also taught other people martial arts, like actors Steve McQueen and James Coburn and basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, he also inspired many other actors who are famous for using martial arts in their movies including Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Chuck Norris.
